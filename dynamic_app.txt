dynamic app backend design

needs to work with both psql and mongodb

This shouldn't actually be that hard though - the point isn't to create something complex, it's to create something bare minimum. Like a list of animals in PostgreSQL and a list of vegetables in MongoDB.

- Set up the basic backend in Express

- Set up mongo db cluster(https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

- Set up routes for RESTful communication with psql and mongo (just create and getAll for now)

- Set up the frontend in React
  - half the page lists animals and lets you submit your own
  - half the page lists vegetables and lets you submit your own

- Upload to vps

------------------------------------------------------------------

build frontend and move to dist, set up as needed
upload backend with dist folder to github

- set up ps/mongo dbs/schema

------------------------------------------------------------------

- Test in vps
