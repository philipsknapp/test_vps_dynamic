dynamic app backend design

needs to work with both psql and mongodb

This shouldn't actually be that hard though - the point isn't to create something complex, it's to create something bare minimum. Like a list of animals in PostgreSQL and a list of vegetables in MongoDB.

- Set up the basic backend in Express
------------------------------------------------------------------
- set up dotenv to hold database info, pg to connect using that

- set up animals service to select dummy data

- set up index to display it with the route /animals/3000

- set up git repo (make sure to ignore .env)








------------------------------------------------------------------

- Set up mongo db cluster
- Set up routes for RESTful communication with psql and mongo
- Test locally

- Set up the frontend in React
  - half the page lists animals and lets you submit your own
  - half the page lists vegetables and lets you submit your own
- Test locally

- Upload to vps
- set up ps/mongo dbs/schema
- Test in vps
